<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The year 2013 will without
doubt be a great year for many of us wondering what's in store for
us. Expert forecasters are predicting it will be one of the best
years ever. It will be one of those years when record numbers of
people will stick to and keep their New Year's resolutions. That
means millions of smokers will quit smoking and the overweight will
make a more conscious effort to trim their waistlines. It should also
be an easier year on the pocket as the world economy recovers
slightly from its recent shocks and downturns. In technology, all
eyes will be on Apple to see if it will launch another revolutionary
product. Industry insiders say rumours are spreading of an Apple
television.</font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">There is
also good news for those hoping to make gains with their English. An
abundance of great new tools will hit the shelves of both online and
traditional stores throughout the year. These will provide students
with an unprecedented variety of products to help them in areas they
want to improve on. The Internet will also see a lot more sites aimed
at providing students with ways to interact with others around the
world in English. More and more learners will study English in
cyberspace from a growing army of online teachers. 2013 will also see
record numbers of people studying abroad, but not just English -
millions will start learning Chinese, as China grows increasingly
important in business.</font></font></p>
