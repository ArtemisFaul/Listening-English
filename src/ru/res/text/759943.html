French man who was unemployed tried a new way to get a job. He put
his CV (résumé) on a giant billboard. The billboard was next to a
very busy road. It was four metres long and three metres high. There
was a photo of the man wearing a Santa Claus hat. There was a message
on the billboard that said: &quot;Trilingual operations manager seeks
position in hotels, restaurants, tourism and leisure.&quot; About
70,000 people a day could see the CV from their car. Jobseeker
Laurent Le Bret, 41, said: &quot;All I want for Christmas is a job.&quot;
His idea worked. A holiday resort contacted and interviewed him. He
started his new position as an operations manager ten days after he
put his résumé on the billboard.</span></font></font></p>

<i><u><b><font color="#000000"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="background: #ffffff">Mr
Le Bret had help from the owner of the billboard. He was going to pay
to put his CV on the billboard. However, the advertising company
decided to give him the space for free. Mr Le Bret saved 2,000 euros
(about $2,700) because he did not have to pay. The advertising
company is called Pisoni Publicité. The company's CEO spoke to the
France 24 news agency. He said: &quot;We thought it was an
interesting idea. When people come up with ideas like this we are
always keen to see what we can do. We're very happy to prove that
what we do works, and that Mr Le Bret is back at work.&quot; Many
people contacted Mr Le Bret after he got his job. They want to try
the same thing. There are 3.3 million unemployed people in
France.<br/>
