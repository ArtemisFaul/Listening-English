interview normally takes place by me being informed that the
candidate has arrived, in which case, um, I leave my office and go to
greet him in the reception area and bring him personally into my
office and sit him across the desk, or across my office desk to me,
and we proceed, uh, from there … . I normally start by asking the
candidate to tell me what he … since he’s been probably through
two or three other interviews previous … what the job is that he’s
being expected to do, just to make sure that he understands fully.
Then I ask him to tell me a little bit about the company that we’re
working for, that I’m working for anyway, so that he’s at least
understood exactly what we do or the basics of what we do anyway …
er then I normally review his CV, and in particular either his
previous employment or his current employment which is very
important. Basically this is done to try to draw the candidate out,
see how good he is at expressing himself, and to see what kind of
character he is. Then I normally give him my views of what the
position is that we’re recruiting for and also my view about the
company, then I normally give him a period of 5 or 10 minutes to ask
some questions. Then I go back to him and just talk about him, and
maybe then when he’s fully relaxed, or more relaxed, put a few of
the trick questions, not a few, I would say one or maybe two maximum.</span></font></p>

<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">As I said in a previous
question, it normally lasts a minimum of 45 minutes if the candidate
is up to scratch and can go for about an hour.</font></p>
