Prime Minister David Cameron is implementing a big change in the
languages taught in UK schools. On a visit to China, he told
journalists that British schools should teach Mandarin instead of
French and German. He told his hosts that he plans to double the
number of students studying Chinese in British schools to 400,000 in
the next three years. He will also provide subsidies to schools that
start teaching Mandarin. He believes stronger educational ties with
China are a necessary element in keeping Britain competitive in the
Chinese market. He said: &quot;I want Britain linked up to the
world's fast-growing economies, and that includes our young people
learning the languages to seal tomorrow's business deals.&quot;</span></font></font></p>

Cameron explained to journalists the importance of introducing
Mandarin in UK schools. He said: &quot;By the time the children born
today leave school, China is set to be the world's largest economy,
so it's time to look beyond the traditional focus on French and
German and get many more children learning Mandarin.&quot; The
initiative includes a tie-up with the British Council and the Chinese
office for teaching Mandarin as a foreign language. They have already
signed an agreement to double the number of Chinese language
assistants in UK schools. The British Council puts Mandarin in the
top five most important languages for British children to study to
improve their job prospects.</span></font></font></p>
