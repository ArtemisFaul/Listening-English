new report says less than ten per cent of Britain's engineers are
women. This is the lowest figure of all European countries. Vince
Cable, the UK Business Secretary, told reporters that this would be
an &quot;enormous problem for years to come&quot;. He said one of the
biggest areas that needed more women was in computer science. Many
women graduate from university with degrees in computer science, so
Mr Cable did not understand why there were so few female computer
engineers. He suggested that many companies had a &quot;psychological
barrier&quot; against women becoming engineers. He said: &quot;Half
of all state schools don't have a single girl doing physics. We are
only tapping half the population.&quot;</span></font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The
British government has started a new campaign to get more women into
engineering. It is called &quot;Tomorrow's Engineers Week&quot; and
started on November the 4th. Mr Cable said at the launch:
&quot;Engineering has a vital role to play in the future of UK
industry. It is important that we act now to ensure businesses have
access to the skills they require to enable them to grow.&quot; A
spokesman for Siemens UK said Britain needed to &quot;help young
people understand how an engineering [training programme] can lead to
a rewarding career&quot;. The campaign website said it would
&quot;showcase all the exciting businesses and industriesâ€¦that rely
on the work of creative engineers.&quot;</font></font></p>
