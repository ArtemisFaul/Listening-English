you can take the difference between the two. It is important that the
guy, the person, is well presented, is neat and tidy, and that he has
a good manner, uh, because that shows a lot about his personality.</span></font></p>

<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Well, it’s not the question
of preparing himself. In the position in which I am, uh, normally the
candidate’s had at least one or maybe two interviews with other
members, more junior member of staff before he gets to my level,
unless the particular candidate is going to report to me, and in
which case I expect the person concerned to have a fairly good
knowledge of: (1) what the company does, (2) what he’s going to be
expected to do, and (3) who he’s going to report to. Those things,
those three items are very, very important and if the candidate, uh,
does not give an impression of either understanding one of those
three items, then obviously then he gets marked down accordingly.</font></p>

</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The major way a candidate goes
wrong is by basically becoming a yes-man or yes-woman and agreeing
with everything you say. What is most important … One of the most
important things about interviewing a candidate is the chemistry
between somebody, between the two people in the interview, em, it’s
very important – he has to have a spark, you have to feel as though
that guy is going to contribute, that guy’s going to be good and
you’re going to get something out of that person and he has to show
himself to be not just “Yes sir, thank you very much. Yes, I agree
with that, I agree with that”. Sometimes I lay dummy questions in
which I want a “no” answer and if he continues to say “yes”
then he goes down.</font></p>

candidate, er, going to an interview? How would you advise him?</font></p>

</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Uh, the first thing I would
say to him is first of all to listen, secondly, to ask the right
questions, and thirdly, perhaps the most important, is to create the
right relationship which is, I guess, an adult-to- adult relationship
with the interviewee or the interviewer. It is very important and
that’s what I said before is when you get a yes-man in front of
you, or a yes-woman, then that person is obviously not creating an
adult-to- adult conversation. He’s creating an adult-to-child
conversation and in most cases, managers are not, if they’re good
and they know what they want, they’re not going to be interested in
employing a child.</font></p>
