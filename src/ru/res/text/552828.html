we started relying on the internet hugely a few years ago and rely on
it even more now, we do our online banking, we do shopping, set a
traffic light onto the internet uh.... We run our lives online and
the criminals know that. They want to disrupt things, they want
information. It's been going on for a while. It's only going to get
worse. We talk about, you know, tens of thousands of viruses being
discovered every year but it’s just the tip of the iceberg.</span></font></p>

I hacked an old BT system corporate style of British Telecom Company
five years ago now uh... including an account of Prince Philip, the
Queen's husband. We didn't do any damage uh... but it was important
legal test case because in those days it wasn’t illegal in the UK
to hack into computers. </span></font>

They are doing what they think needs to be done unless their products
and services out there some of them very easy some much more
complicated but they're always going to be a weaker or weakest link
in the chain… and in lots of places that people uh... everybody has
access nowadays within the company to a huge amount of important data
and the hackers know there're always ways to get it. If they can’t
hack into computers, if they can't guess the passwords, they’ll
hang around in a restaurant…it sounds like the people work through
phone not pretend to be a member of staff: “I have forgotten my
password. Please, can you reset it for me?” There are always ways
to get that information. And when you look at what newspapers have in
the fact … that newspapers nowadays are all digital… When I was
working in Germany twenty five years ago if you want to the editor
store you took a scalpel, you took some sticky tape and you change
the story on the page. Nowadays you type something and go straight to
the presses. The risks and the implications, perhaps of somebody
intercepting, matter huge.</span></font></p>
