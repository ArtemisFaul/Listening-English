computer software will soon be keeping an eye on you, or on your
eyes, when you go shopping. It is called the Sideways project because
it tracks the movement of your eyes as you glance at products on
shelves. The researchers, from Britain's Lancaster University, told
the BBC that the technology would be a common feature in stores
before the end of the decade. Senior researcher Andreas Bulling said:
&quot;The system uses a single ordinary cameraâ€¦[It] detects the
faces of people walking by and calculates where the eyes are relative
to the eye corners.&quot; This information is then used to flash up
adverts related to what products you were looking at longest as you
pass by video screens ahead of you.</font></font></p>

<font color="#000000"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Eye-tracking
technology is being used in a number of different situations. One is
to help motorists better identify cyclists on roads. Studies suggest
drivers are five times likelier to spot pedestrians than people
riding bicycles. This could significantly cut the number of road
deaths. Eye-tracking can also be used to allow people to use their
eyes as a mouse to scroll through and select content on screens.
Disabled people are already using this technology to enhance their
daily mobility. Last month the tech giant Samsung launched a
smartphone that monitors what users look at on-screen. Mr Bulling
said: &quot;It is really gaining momentum. I fully expect this
technology to become available widely in the near future.&quot;</font></font></p>
