<body lang="ru-RU" dir="ltr">
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I’m very glad to see you are
interested in learning more about Japan, because you will never be
able to do business in Japan unless you understand some basic …
basic aspects of Japanese management and Japanese corporate culture
in general.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">In my seminars, I usually talk
about three fundamental principals of Japanese management. The first
one is the emphasis on the group in Japanese corporations. The second
is the importance of human interpersonal relationships. And the last
point I discuss is the role of Japanese managers as generalists and
facilitators.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">All right then, we’ll talk
about, briefly, these three principles. The first point then, the
emphasis on the group. This group orientation manifests itself in the
following example (you can yourself conduct this experiment). If you
ask any Japanese businessman what he does, he will almost invariably
answer by saying, “I am a Sony man”, or “I work for
Mitsubishi”, or “I’m with such or such company”, instead of
telling you, if he’s a, whether he’s an engineer or an
accountant. For instance, you see.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">This point, this emphasis on
group, the group orientation explains the other two principles as
well. For instance, Japan is geographically is an island. It’s an
island nation, it’s like a boat with an overcrowded homogeneous
population. So this explains partially already why this group
orientation is so important and also necessary for the very survival
of Japan and Japanese corporations as well. You see, by the way, the
people are the only resource Japan possesses. It’s an island nation
without any other natural resources. So it’s the question of
survival also.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">

<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><i>Short pause here</i></font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<br/>

</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">That leads us to the second
question, the second emphasis rather, namely the emphasis on human or
interpersonal factors or relationships. In this overcrowded island
nation, in order to achieve or survive together, they have to learn,
like I said, to get along, and in order to achieve this, there are
certain things they have to learn, like harmony. How do you achieve
harmony? By, by er sacrificing a little bit of self-interest for the
sake of the group. And also by compromising, by trying to have
everybody agree, namely, to achieve or to arrive at the consensus of
the group. You see. </font>
</p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Once you are employed, or
hired by a company, you remain with this company until you
retirement, the so-called “lifetime employment”. That explains a
lot of things already, like seniority order, because you enter the
company along with your peers, the same age group. You graduated from
the university together, so you get promoted together, and so you
climb this company, organizational ladder, little by little together,
slowly but steady.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
 <font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><i>Short pause here</i></font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The last and third point or
principle is a view of managers or executives as generalists and
facilitators, rather than decision-makers.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">In general, in a Japanese
corporation, everybody is more or less trained to be a generalist
rather than the specialist. So even if you are an engineer, when you
have just joined the company, you will have this orientation and you
will be transferred from one department to the other and you’ll be
rotated in every department of the company to familiarize yourself
with the entire company and for instance, since you are not narrowly
specializing in one field, you can take over somebody else’s role.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">I also talk about “ringisho”
usually translated as &quot;the management by consensus”. That
means that all the employees participate in the process of
decision-making. They form small groups in each department and they
discuss the matter with each other. They arrive at an agreement, the
consensus, and then the departmental chief or the executive will have
to agree himself or herself.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">And this way, the consensus is
achieved. Everybody is involved in the process. It’s not like, say,
an American way of decision-making by one big executive or the
president.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">This is just a brief
description of my seminars, but I think if you attend them, I can
give you even more insight into Japanese corporate culture, which I
think will help you greatly in your coming business trip to Japan.</font></p>
