you haven’t heard about the Bologna Process yet, then the odds are
that you soon will. And no, before you ask, it’s not a new way of
cooking pasta! Instead, the Bologna Process is a voluntary initiative
that is changing the face of education across Europe – and that’s
starting to have a knock-on effect elsewhere as well.</span></font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">What I’m going to try and do
today is tell you a bit about the initiative before moving on to
explore what it involves in more detail.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Named after the Italian city
where the idea was first forward, the Bologna Process aims to create
a European “higher education area” by making academic degree and
quality control standards more compatible and easier to compare with
one another.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Now, for many people across
the EU, any mention of Europe-wide initiatives is terrifying! There
have been countless ridiculous media scare stories about unelected
bureaucrats in Brussels telling us what size bananas we are – and
aren’t – allowed to eat or about football supporters supposedly
being forced to wear earplugs at matches due to crazy health and
safety measures. Obviously, for some traditionalists, the idea of any
kind of standardization is too much for them to bear.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">However, it seems to me that
almost anything is better than the way things were. Under the old
system, credits were sometimes awarded to students based simply on
the number of hours they’d done. This led to some countries
refusing to recognize qualifications from others. Under Bologna,
credits will be based on learning outcomes – or what students have
actually achieved – rather than length of study. There will also be
greater emphasis placed on project work, practical experiments,
research, presentations and so on.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">This will mean both students
and academic staff can move around the Euro zone more easily, without
always having to explain their qualifications! It should also mean
that Europe becomes a more attractive destination for non-European
students.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">The main change happening is
that most European countries are getting rid of the four-or-five year
degree courses they used to offer and instead are starting to adopt a
British and Irish style system of three-year degrees. These are then
followed by two-year Master’s degrees and three-year doctoral
degrees – or PhDs.</font></p>
<p lang="en-US" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%">
<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Many countries have introduced
radical reforms, changing not only degree and Master’s courses, but
introducing tuition fees, restructuring departments and allowing
universities to have much greater autonomy, decentralizing the
curricula, allowing the creation of private universities, and so on.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%"><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><span lang="en-US">Of
course, these changes have not gone unchallenged – and what I want
to do now is to consider the negative responses more fully. Public
reaction has been particularly heated in Greece, where there have
been massive demonstrations against Bologna, sit-ins and even riots.
France has seen general strikes – and even the UK is worried that
it will now lose its appeal, as it is no longer the only country to
offer shorter degree courses! </span></font>
