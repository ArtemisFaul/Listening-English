<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">Good morning everyone. It’s
great to be in Boston today. Thank you for inviting me. As you know,
I’ve been asked to share some ideas on the Dana Corporation
management style. I’ll be happy to take questions at the end, but
before I get going, can I ask you a question? How many of you have
heard of the Dana Corporation? Can you raise your hand if you have?
Excellent. Thank you. OK, for those that don’t know us, I’d like
to begin with a very brief overview of Dana. We’ll look at who we
are, what we do, and how we do it. OK. So, who is Dana? Dana is one
of the largest automotive component suppliers in the world – last
year we reported sales of $13.2 billion. We employ more than 82,000
people in thirty-two countries in some 320 facilities … </font>

<font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><span lang="en-US">you see,
success in business is 10% money and 90% people. As I was just
saying, our philosophy is: “People are our most important assets.”
And that brings me to my next point: we believe in education,
participation, and innovation. We promote from within and our goal is
at least forty hours of education per year for every person in Dana.
We even have our own university and I’d like to show you some
statistics about that. Now, you know what people say about
statistics, don’t you? 43.3 % of statistics are meaningless. Well,
here are some that are very meaningful. As you can see from this
table, we’ve had 53,000 participants at Dana University to date,
and 147 of our people have received MBAs …</span></font></p>

… <font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt">and that’s why we always
say: communicate, communicate, communicate. OK, let’s turn to our
ideas programme now and this is very exciting. The Dana ideas
programme is much more than simple suggestion scheme. Every person in
our organization is encouraged to submit at least two ideas for
improvement per month and we implement 80% of them. Think about it.
Two ideas a month, times 82,000 employees worldwide – that’s more
than two million ideas per year – two million ways to improve
quality, productivity, and efficiency. Let’s look at an example of
how this works. In one Dana facility, we had an assembly worker who
noticed that … </font>
