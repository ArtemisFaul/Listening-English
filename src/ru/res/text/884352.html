ever an ideal time to start a business? Surprisingly, a recession can
provide excellent opportunities to launch a new company. It’s a
time when many existing firms are going out of business, money
lenders are seeking entrepreneurs with ambitions and strong
qualifications, and governments may be offering generous financial
support in an effort to get the economy moving again. One key tip for
a successful start-up is to get in while the going is good.</font></font></p>

to the US government’s Small Business Administration (SBA), seven
out of ten new companies exist at least two years and 51 per cent at
least five years. Having a good idea for a product or service is the
essential first step, but it is important to learn as much as
possible about your potential market. Will there be enough demand for
the product, and who might also be selling something similar?</font></font></p>

essential in the process of getting money to finance the idea,
whether you are trying to borrow money from the bank, are hoping to
attract venture capital (VC) or are pitching the idea to a so called
