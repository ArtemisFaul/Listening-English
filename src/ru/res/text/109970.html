friends all said it was really easy to use, but it took me ages to
get the hang of the Internet. I suppose the more you use it the
quicker you get. For me, it’s a very environmentally-friendly
thing. I use it mainly for up-to-date news or references, so instead
of getting into my car and driving down to the library, I just try my
favourite search engine. I’d say in 99% of cases I find what I’m
looking for in less time than it would take me to find what I’m
looking for in books. And I’ve stopped getting a daily paper.</span></font></p>

rooms – I’m addicted to them. I can’t believe how easy it is to
talk to people. It’s how I keep in touch with my friends and
family. At the moment I’m having regular chats with my older
brother who’s in Thailand. It’s almost as good as the phone and
so much cheaper. I’ve got into a few chats with people I don’t
know, but I haven’t made any new friends though. I think it’s a
bit scary – the idea that you can get to know someone in a chat
room. You don’t really know anything about people – I mean,
everything they tell you could easily be lies.</span></font></p>

use it for various things – you know, the obvious ones – getting
information, news, shopping. But the best thing so far is tracking
down people I was at school with. There are quite a few sites now
where you can get in touch with people. It’s amazing: I’ve
already found three people who were in the same class as me at
primary school. I’ve even met one of them who still lives quite
near here. And I’m in email contact with someone I was at
university with. She lives in the States now. I said I’d go and
visit her next year if I could. It’s fantastic!</span></font></p>

definitely. It has to be music. That’s about all I use it for
really, apart from occasionally checking the sports results. It’s
fantastic if you’re into modern music of any kind. I go on some of
the music sites and download all kinds of MP3 files. Some of it’s a
bit weird. If you’ve got your own CD burner you can make top
quality CDs for next to nothing. The music industry’s trying to
crack down on the illegal copying. They say they’re losing sales
because people like me aren’t buying as many CDs. I reckon they’re
fighting a loosing battle. The thing is, apart from being free, it’s
amazingly quick.</span></font></p>

5. </b></span></font><font size="4" style="font-size: 14pt"><span lang="en-US">I
have to admit I fell in love with the Internet the first time I used
it. I’d heard this incredible CD on the radio and I have to have
it. Most of the music shops in town said they’d never heard of the
band. I phoned a specialist shop in London and asked if they had in
stock, but they said it was only available as an import. That’s
when I tried the Internet. I looked up the name of the band and found
a list of their recordings. I put the CD I wanted into my basket,
typed in my address and credit card number, and three days later it
arrived by post. Magic!</span></font></p>
